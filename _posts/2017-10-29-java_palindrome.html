<p>As most people know, a palindrome string is one which reads the same backwards as it does forwards. English examples include "Madam, I'm Adam" and "racecar".</p>

<p>Eagle-eyed readers will point out that the first of these is not, strictly speaking, a palindrome, for it contains a comma and an apostrophe and cannot therefore be regarded as a palindrome in a programming context.</p>

<p>In any case, palindrome checking is a very common challenge set for applicants during a tech job interview. Though this challenge might seem totally disconnected from practical reality, palindromes do occur in nature and it could be useful to know how to recognise them programmatically if you are dealing with <a href="http://www.biology-pages.info/P/Palindromes.html">biological data</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">In this post we're going to explore three different ways of solving this problem in Java. For the sake of simplicity we will assume that the string is predefined and there is no need to process user input. Although every solution presented here is technically <i>O(n)</i> in time complexity, we examine this in more detail in order to determine the best solution.</blockquote>

<h2 class="section-heading">One Possible Solution</h2>

<p>Initially this solution seems convincing; it is intuitive and concise and simply executes an <i>equality</i> comparison between the string and its reversed form.</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">A simple and relatively inefficient solution to the palindrome checker problem</span>

<p>We need to examine this algorithm more closely to get a better idea of how good its performance is in terms of time and space complexity. Measured using <i>O(n)</i> notation, this algorithm is <i>O(n)</i> i.e. linear. We will only focus on time complexity to keep things simple.</p>

<p>On closer consultation of the Java docs, it becomes clear that in the worst-case scenario - i.e. when the string <i>is</i> a palindrome - the time complexity equates to <i>3n + 16</i>, the constant 16 term arising as a result of StringBuilder() freeing up 16 memory slots when creating a string.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">Let's see if we can do a little bit better than that.</blockquote>

<h2 class="section-heading">A Second Possible Solution</h2>

<p>Though the code here initially appears more complex than the previous solution, it does represent an improvement in terms of time complexity.</p>

<img style="width: 84%; margin-left: 8%" class="img-fluid" src="/img/java/better_solution.png" alt="Better Solution">
<span class="caption text-muted">A slightly more efficient solution to the palindrome checker problem</span>

<p>Considering the worst-case scenario, this program will iterate over the entire length of the string, implying a time complexity of <i>n</i>, since it makes exactly <i>n</i> inequality checks in this case.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">A Third Possible Solution</h2>

<p>However, there is actually no need to perform so many inequality checks. It is illogical to iterate over the entire length of the string as it is sufficient to compare the first half to the second half.</p>

<img style="width: 84%; margin-left: 8%" class="img-fluid" src="/img/java/best_solution.png" alt="Best Solution">
<span class="caption text-muted">The most efficient of the solutions to the palindrome checker problem</span>

<p>Hence we can implement the above solution which is <i>n/2</i> in time complexity in the worst-case scenario (the string being a palindrome). If the length of the string is an odd number, this is reduced to <i>(n - 1)/2</i>.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">So that marks the end of today's post. The goal of this article was to explain the finer points of this problem. Let me know if you spotted any inaccuracies in the post.</blockquote>
