<p><a href="https://level-apps.co.uk">LevelApps<a/> recently came across an issue with React Native maps, revolving around the map package's inability to automatically adjust zoom level in accordance with geographical data spread.</p>

<p>The team were rendering a variety of eateries lying within a given radius (in kilometres) of the user's location, but they noticed that they needed to set the map's zoom level manually.</p>

<p>After some judicious online research, the team stumbled upon a convenient solution which allowed them to calculate a tailored zoom level depending on the search radius.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Basic Problem</h2>

<p>Latitude and longitude deltas determine the amount of west-east distance to be displayed on the map. In practice, the map computes two ratios (longitude delta to map width and latitude delta to map height) and uses the greater of the two to set the zoom level that the end user sees.</p>

<p>Uppermost in our minds was the need to avoid situations where a significant number of eateries were outside the default map viewport, thereby requiring the user to scroll to see them.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Geometry to the Rescue</h2>
<p>Eventually <a href="https://level-apps.co.uk">LevelApps<a/> found a solution which enabled them to overcome this rather irksome issue.</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">Equations used to overcome the <i>delta problem</i></span>

<p>The equation only required three arguments: the search radius and the user's current latitude and longitude.</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">Map zoom level with a search radius of <i>10 kilometres</i></span>

<p>That meant the map self-adjusted depending on the user-specified search radius.</p>

<img style="width: 40%; margin-left: 30%" class="img-fluid" src="/img/geometry/map_100_km.png" alt="100km Radius">
<span class="caption text-muted">Map zoom level with a search radius of <i>100 kilometres</i></span>

<p>When the search radius widened, the zoom level was decreased accordingly, resulting in a user-friendly map experience.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Reflections</h2>

<p>Unfortunately the map is still not as well configured as it could be. Ideally the map's zoom level would also factor in other considerations, like the most outlying data point. That way we could ensure that every single data point was neatly enclosed in the map with unused map space kept to a minimum.</p>
