<p>As demand for mobile applications continues to outpace supply, a number of promising cross-platform solutions have emerged to respond to rising consumer demand in a market that was valued at <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US42639118">$76 billion</a> in 2017.</p>

<p>One of the most prominent cross-platform mobile development solutions is Facebook's React Native, which already boasts a substantial developer community.</p>

<p>Many major brands rely on React Native for their mobile app, among them Britain's <i>Guardian</i> broadsheet and <i>Walmart</i>.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Key Features of React</h2>

<p>React itself is a JavaScript library which is efficient, flexible and blazingly fast. It operates on the "components" model whereby developers can assemble an intricate UI composed of a series of components of varying sizes.</p>

<p>As mentioned, React is centred around reusable components which enable developers to maintain their code with ease in even the largest of projects.</p>

<p>The application architecture Flux is used to implement the unidirectional data flow which is one of React's defining features.</p>

<p>In this article we will be taking a look at some of the most versatile and underrated React Native components which can help you create dynamic, responsive, visually engaging apps.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">React Native Pagination</h2>

<p>When you're dealing with vast quantities of data it's sometimes difficult to figure out how to present that data in a stimulating yet intuitive way. That's where this particular component <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.levelapps.nuv">steps in</a>.</p>

<img style="width: 40%; margin-left: 30%" class="img-fluid" src="/img/native_components/pagination.gif" alt="Pagination">
<span class="caption text-muted"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.levelapps.nuv">Sample use</a> of the npm package <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-pagination">react-native-pagination</a></span>

<p>Although it can be hard to tailor it to your particular needs, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-pagination">this package</a> offers several convenient options, including one which gives you a horizontally scrolling list.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">This makes a fantastic alternative to the conventional React Native <i>FlatList</i> which, while solid and reliable, is not quite as fresh and pleasing to the eye as this.</blockquote>

<h2 class="section-heading">React Native Modal Overlay</h2>

<p>Sometimes you need to provide prompt, concise user feedback in response to a given action - a button click, text input etc. Fortunately React Native boasts a wealth of suitable components which perform admirably in such situations, most notably the one used in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.levelapps.nuv">app</a> shown below.</p>

<img style="width: 40%; margin-left: 30%" class="img-fluid" src="/img/native_components/modal_overlay.gif" alt="Modal Overlay">
<span class="caption text-muted"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.levelapps.nuv">Sample use</a> of the npm package <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-modal-overlay">react-native-modal-overlay</a></span>

<p>The modal overlay is a neat solution if you're looking for a component which is easy to close and will fit into a delicately balanced UI. Thanks to the <span style="background-color: dimgray; color: white"> closeOnTouchOutside</span> prop, a single click outside the component will close it.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">React Native Circle Slider</h2>

<p>This is a fantastic component which offers a number of customisable props. Based on the npm react-native-svg package, it allows the user to specify a range and configure the line weights, as shown in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.weather2.weather2wed&hl=en_GB&rdid=com.weather2.weather2wed">app</a> below.</p>

<img style="width: 40%; margin-left: 30%" class="img-fluid" src="/img/native_components/circle_slider.gif" alt="Circle Slider">
<span class="caption text-muted"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.weather2.weather2wed&hl=en_GB&rdid=com.weather2.weather2wed">Sample use</a> of the npm package <a href="https://github.com/raymondchooi/react-native-circle-slider">react-native-circle-slider</a></span>

<p>Possible use cases for this component include date selection, percentage selection or just about any other case which involves choosing a value within a finite range. There's little doubt that it would bring a bit of visual flair to any UI!</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">React Native Multi Switch</h2>

<p>Often a registration form field requires the user to choose between two or three fixed options. In such cases the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-multi-switch">React Native multi switch package</a> could prove immensely valuable to your project.</p>

<img style="width: 40%; margin-left: 30%" class="img-fluid" src="/img/native_components/multi_switch.gif" alt="Multi-Switch">
<span class="caption text-muted"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.levelapps.nuv">Sample use</a> of the npm package <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-multi-switch">react-native-multi-switch</a></span>

<p>In the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.levelapps.nuv">app</a> above, the component has been customised to a considerable extent, but the core functionality remains unchanged from the basic npm package.</p>

<img style="width: 40%; margin-left: 30%" class="img-fluid" src="/img/native_components/multi_switch_2.gif" alt="Multi-Switch">
<span class="caption text-muted"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.levelapps.nuv">Sample use</a> of the npm package <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-multi-switch">react-native-multi-switch</a></span>

<p>In this particular <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.levelapps.nuv">example</a>, the component is used to toggle between different categories of content.</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">React Native Autocomplete Input</h2>

<p>Any search bar is greatly enhanced with the addition of a predictive search feature like the one seen in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.levelapps.findasaur">app</a> below.</p>

<img style="width: 40%; margin-left: 30%" class="img-fluid" src="/img/native_components/autocomplete.gif" alt="Autocomplete Input">
<span class="caption text-muted"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.levelapps.findasaur">Sample use</a> of the npm package <a href="https://github.com/mrlaessig/react-native-autocomplete-input">react-native-autocomplete-input</a></span>

<p>Of the 5 components featured in this article, this one may be the trickiest to get to grips with for someone taking their first steps in the React Native world, but it's absolutely worth it once you discover this component's transformative effect on your app's user-friendliness.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">That brings us to the end of this quick and easy React Native components showcase. Hopefully it has given you some inspiration for how you can make your next React Native app the best one yet.</blockquote>
